                <p class="first"> This was my photo after our Graduation Ceremony for the Graduates of Batch 2022-2023. I graduated in Senior High with the strand of
                    Science Technology Engineering and Mathematics and I am a with honors. It was a rough and long journey before I got on that moment,
                    many trials that I've faces and also regrets that make me want to quit. I was so thankful for the favor that was given to me by the almighty God
                    despite the trials and circumstances a long the way but he never leave me. I was thankful for the knowledge and strength that I was able
                    to survive until the end.

                    career that we make. They always give us encouragement as we pursue our dreams and goals in life, teach us to strive hard so that we will not be the same
                    like them and have a better life. They also teach us to always be humble and be contented of what we have. I really love my family and they are my inspirations
                    to achieve my goals in life.</p>

            <p class="third">I just want to flex this photo of mine go back 2016 when I am at the 5th grade in elementary. This photo was taken during Regional Meet at Camiguin Island. During those
               times, I won two gold medals in Long Jump and High Jump and I am qualified to participate in the Palarong Pambansa 2017 that will be held at that time in San Jose De Buenavista
               Antique Province. I am an student athlete before and it was fun being an athlete becasue you can get a chance to explore and meeting people from different places. But being an 
               athlete is also hard because you will get far to your family and the training was not a joke, it was so intense. But at the end, I was greatful to have those kinds of experience
               during my childhood because I won't be experiencing it on college.
