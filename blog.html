                        <p>In this lesson I learned about data processing. I learned the basic information process, the INPUT which

                            to data to produce the organized data. The third one is STORAGE, it is the part were the computer save 
                            the information for a subsequent use in the future. Lastly, the OUPTUT were the computer send the information
                            to people in usable format.
